    Iterate through subgroups of the epoches contained by a parent epoch

    Parameters
    ----------
    epochs : dataframe with 'name', 'start', 'end'
        Epochs to filter through
    epoch_name_regex : str
        Regular expression that will be used to identify parent epochs to
        iterate through.

    Returns
    -------
    Iterator yielding a tuple of (parent epoch name, dataframe containing subset
    of epochs contained by parent epoch).

    Example
    '''

    regex_b : string
