# Quick Start

## I just want to analyze data! Where should I put my script?
   
If you are just hacking around, please put your code in `scripts` -- it's for any one-off analysis or snippet of code that isn't yet ready for reuse by other people. We recommend using `scripts/demo_script.py` as a guide for the types of operations that you may find useful. 

There is an [xforms](docs/xforms.md) system for batching and saving analyses in a way that you can reload later; this was what we used in the `scripts/fit_model.py` command. We also have a good tutorial/template at `scripts/demo_script.py`. We recommend beginners make a copy of it and edit it as needed. You may run it with:

```
# Run the demo script
python3 scripts/demo_script.py
```

The `tests/` directory is intended for unit tests that run automatically with `pytest`.

## Where should I put my data? Where should I save my results?

### Input Data

If your data is in [Recording](recordings.md) format, put it in the `recordings/` directory. If it is not yet in recording form, you may want to make a conversion script in `scripts/` that is able convert your data from your custom format into [Signals](signals.md) and [Recordings](recordings.md). 

Below is some pseudocode for a script that converts your data from a custom format and then save it as a Signal to make it easier for other people to use. 

```
from nems.signal import Signal

numpy_array = load_my_custom_data_format(...)
sig = Signal(matrix=numpy_array, 
             name='mysignal',
             recording='some-string', 
             fs=200  # Hz
             )
sig.save('../recordings/my-new-recording/my-new-signal')
```

### Output Results

Once you have fit a model to a recording, you can save the resulting files either locally in your `nems/results` directory, or to a remote [database](database.md) server.
