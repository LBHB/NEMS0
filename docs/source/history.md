## History ##

NEMS is the third incarnation of a predictive modeling tool developed at the David Lab at Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon. The first incarnation, written in MATLAB, was called [NARF: the Neural Analysis Regression Framework](https://bitbucket.org/lbhb/narf), and was used to test about a million different models on neural data. The second version was a fairly literal port of NARF into Python, which was subsequently refactored into this current third incarnation to be more widely useable.
