NEMS Demos
==========

How to Run Demos
----------------

These demos are formatted as Jupyter notebooks. There are two ways to run them.
One is to launch your preferred Python environment with NEMS installed. Then
cut/paste code from the pages below into your Python console.

An alternative is to copy the notebooks from nems/docs/source/demos/ to
a working directory and open them using Jupyter Notebooks/Jupyter Lab. More
information on using Jupyter here:
