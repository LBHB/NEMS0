NEMS Demos
==========

Demo scripts
------------

The ``NEMS/scripts/`` folder contains a number of files ``demo_*.py`` that illustrate
different aspects of working with NEMS. A good place to start is ``demo_script.py``.

Demo Notebooks
--------------

These demos are formatted as Jupyter notebooks. There are two ways to run them.
One is to launch your preferred Python environment with NEMS installed. Then
cut/paste code from the pages below into your Python console.

An alternative is to copy the notebooks from nems/docs/source/demos/ to
a working directory and open them using Jupyter Notebooks/Jupyter Lab. More
information on using Jupyter here:
